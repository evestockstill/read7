"Express is a fast, un-opinionated minimalist web framework for Node.js" - official web site: Expressjs.com

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It provides various features that make web application
development fast and easy which otherwise takes more time using only Node.js.

Express.js is based on the Node.js middleware module called connect which in turn uses http module. So, any middleware
which is based on connect will also work with Express.js.
Routing
Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing, see
Basic routing.

You define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, app.get() to
handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests. For a full list, see app.METHOD. You can also use app.all() to
handle all HTTP methods and app.use() to specify middleware as the callback function (See Using middleware for details).

These routing methods specify a callback function (sometimes called “handler functions”) called when the application
receives a request to the specified route (endpoint) and HTTP method. In other words, the application “listens” for
requests that match the specified route(s) and method(s), and when it detects a match, it calls the specified callback
function.

 routing methods can have more than one callback function as arguments.

requests that match the specified route(s) and method(s), and when it detects a match, it calls the specified callback
function.

In fact, the routing methods can have more than one callback function as arguments. With multiple callback functions, it
is important to provide next as an argument to the callback function and then call next() within the body of the
function to hand off control to the next callback.

The following code is an example of a very basic route.

var express = require('express')
var app = express()

// respond with "hello world" when a GET request is made to the homepage
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
res.send('hello world')
})
Route methods
A route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the express class.

The following code is an example of routes 

// GET method route
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
res.send('GET request to the homepage')
})

// POST method route
app.post('/', function (req, res) {
res.send('POST request to the homepage')
})
Express supports methods that correspond to all HTTP request methods: get, post, and so on. For a full list, see
app.METHOD.

There is a special routing method, app.all(), used to load middleware functions at a path for all HTTP request methods.
For example, the following handler is executed for requests to the route “/secret” whether using GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,
or any other HTTP request method supported in the http module.

app.all('/secret', function (req, res, next) {
console.log('Accessing the secret section ...')
next() // pass control to the next handler
})
Route paths
Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can
be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.


Express uses path-to-regexp for matching the route paths; see the path-to-regexp documentation for all the possibilities
in defining route paths. Express Route Tester is a handy tool for testing basic Express routes, although it does not
support pattern matching.

Query strings are not part of the route path.

Here are some examples of route paths based on strings.

This route path will match requests to the root route, /.

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
res.send('root')
})

Route parameters
Route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their position in the URL. The
captured values are populated in the req.params object, with the name of the route parameter specified in the path as
their respective keys.

 route parameters, simply specify the route parameters in the path of the route as shown below.

app.get('/users/:userId/books/:bookId', function (req, res) {
res.send(req.params)
})
The name of route parameters must be made up of “word characters” ([A-Za-z0-9_]).

Route handlers
You can provide multiple callback functions that behave like middleware to handle a request. The only exception is that
these callbacks might invoke next('route') to bypass the remaining route callbacks. You can use this mechanism to impose
pre-conditions on a route, then pass control to subsequent routes if there’s no reason to proceed with the current
route.

Route handlers can be in the form of a function, an array of functions, or combinations of both, as shown in the
following examples.

A single callback function can handle a route. For example:



Response methods
The methods on the response object (res) in the following table can send a response to the client, and terminate the
request-response cycle. If none of these methods are called from a route handler, the client request will be left
hanging.

Method Description
res.download() Prompt a file to be downloaded.
res.end() End the response process.
res.json() Send a JSON response.
res.jsonp() Send a JSON response with JSONP support.
res.redirect() Redirect a request.
res.render() Render a view template.
res.send() Send a response of various types.
res.sendFile() Send a file as an octet stream.
res.sendStatus() Set the response status code and send its string representation as the response body.

var express = require('express')
var app = express()


Route methods
A route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the express class.

The following code is an example of routes that are defined for the GET and the POST methods to the root of the app.

// GET method route
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
res.send('GET request to the homepage')
})

// POST method route
app.post('/', function (req, res) {
res.send('POST request to the homepage')
})
Express supports methods that correspond to all HTTP request methods: get, post, and so on. For a full list, see
app.METHOD.

Route paths
Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can
be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.



Express uses path-to-regexp for matching the route paths; 


Route parameters
Route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their position in the URL. The
captured values are populated in the req.params object, with the name of the route parameter specified in the path as
their respective keys.

express methods are GET POST DELETE PUT
